# mycobot-writer-matlab
This GitHub repository is dedicated to creating a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the Elephant Robotics MyCobot 280M5, a versatile 6-axis robot arm. The primary goal of this project is to enable the MyCobot 280M5 to write capital letters, both in a simulation environment and on a real robot.
